# MovieApp

Hi! :wave: :blush:
In this project there was used movie TMdb database API and at the main page you can see the list of movies, also Popular and Top Rated Movie list, which is changable by clicking on certain link. Also you can see a detailed page of a selected single movie.
But not responsive yet. üñêÔ∏è
